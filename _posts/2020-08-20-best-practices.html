<p>Despite all of the benefits that QML and Qt Quick offer, they can be challenging in certain situations. The following
    sections elaborate on some
    of the best practices that will help you get better results when developing applications.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Custom UI Controls</h2>

<p>A fluid and modern UI is key for any application's success in today's world, and that's where QML makes so much sense
    for a designer or
    developer. Qt offers the most basic UI controls that are necessary to create a fluid and modern-looking UI. It is
    recommended to browse this list
    of UI controls before creating your own custom UI control.</p>

<p>Besides these basic UI controls offered by Qt Quick itself, a rich set of UI controls are also available with Qt
    Quick Controls. They cater to the
    most common use cases without any change, and offer a lot more possibilities with their customization options. In
    particular, Qt Quick Controls
    provides styling options that align with the latest UI design trends. If these UI controls do not satisfy your
    application's needs, only then it is
    recommended to create a custom control.</p>
