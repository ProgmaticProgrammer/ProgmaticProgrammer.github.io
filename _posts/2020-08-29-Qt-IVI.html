<h2 class="section-heading">Qt IVI - Facilitate APIs defining</h2>

<p>
    The Qt IVI Generator provides a flexible way to define new APIs via an Interface Definition Language (IDL) and
    generate classes for use, from C++ and QML.
</p>
<p>
    Qt IVI is built around a pattern that separates the API exposed to the application developer, the so called feature,
    and the code that implements it, the backend. There can be multiple backends per feature; the Core module provides
    support for finding the corresponding backend in an easy-to-use way.
</p>
<p>

    The following diagram illustrates the generic architecture in Qt IVI: Middleware API, Middleware Backend, and
    Middleware Service.
