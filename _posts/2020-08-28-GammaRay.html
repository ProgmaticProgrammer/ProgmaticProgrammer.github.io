<h2 class="section-heading">GammaRay - Domain-Specific Debugger</h2>

<p>
    When trying to analyze bugs in your application, 
    an instruction-level debugger is usually your first tool of choice, and rightfully so. 
    Debuggers allow you to follow the program flow and allow you to inspect the state of objects or variables. 
    When using a debugger with proper Qt integration, such as in QtCreator, 
    it will also handle Qt’s own data types correctly. 
    However, when dealing with complex frameworks this level of detail is often too low-level. 
    Keeping an overview in a large scene graph or following the complex interactions between models 
    and views can quickly become a cumbersome task this way.
</p>
<p>
    GammaRay addresses this by providing domain-specific debugging aids on a much higher level. 
    It provides easy ways of navigating through the complex internal structures you find in some Qt frameworks, 
    such as the QtQuick scene graphs, model/view, QTextDocument, state machines and more. 
    Unlike the debugger, GammaRay understands those internal structures and can present them in a meaningful way, 
    making it a tool that should not be missing in any Qt developer’s toolbox.
