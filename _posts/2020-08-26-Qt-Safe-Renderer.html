<h2 class="section-heading">Qt Safe Renderer Overview</h2>
<p>
    Qt Safe Renderer is designed to be integrated into a system that has separate processes for safety-critical and non-safety functionality.
    Qt Safe Renderer ensures graphical rendering of safety-critical information by partitioning the related functionality into an independent subsystem 
    that is run on its own process.
</p>
<p>
    Functional safety applies to many vertical industries, such as automotive, medical, and automation. 
    In the automotive industry, it is essential that safety-critical information in the digital displays is rendered 
    even if some malfunction prevents rendering of the non-safety information in the UI (user interface). 
</p>
<p>
    In medical industry, nurses, doctors, and technicians use safety-critical medical devices 
    that must be safe to use. In automation industry, there is need for well-placed, prominent error indicators.
</p>
<p>
    Examples:
    <ul>
        <li>The detection of brake failure in a car and showing indication about this to a driver.</li>
        <li>The detection of a malfunction in a medical device and shutting down the device operations as a result of this.</li>
    </ul>
 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Use Certified RTOS</h2>
<p>Certified RTOS and toolchain saves time and effort in system level certification.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Use Hypervisor</h2>
<p>A Hypervisor runs separate OS for safety critical and other functionality.
    OS can share resources and data as long as the separation guarantees integrity of the safety critical software.
    Safety critical functionality can be assigned to a dedicated CPU core. 
    Shared resources controlled by Hypervisor(e.g. GPU).

<h2 class="section-heading">Processor Seperation</h2>
<p>Separate processors or a single SoC with separate CPUs to run different OS for safety critical and other functionality.
    A microcontroller CPU may be enough for it. Other functionality can run on embedded Linux.

<h2 class="section-heading">Qt Safe Renderer Runtime</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Safety critical UI drawn to a separate Hardware layer.</li>
        <li>Qt Safe Renderer listens to heartbeat from Main Ui and control it.</li>
        <li>No changes to safety critical code due to UI changes.</li>
    </ul>
