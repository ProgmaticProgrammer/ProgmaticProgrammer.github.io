<h2 class="section-heading">Qt Safe Renderer Overview</h2>
<p>
    Qt Safe Renderer is designed to be integrated into a system that has separate processes for safety-critical and non-safety functionality.
    Qt Safe Renderer ensures graphical rendering of safety-critical information by partitioning the related functionality into an independent subsystem 
    that is run on its own process.
</p>
<p>
    Functional safety applies to many vertical industries, such as automotive, medical, and automation. 
    In the automotive industry, it is essential that safety-critical information in the digital displays is rendered 
    even if some malfunction prevents rendering of the non-safety information in the UI (user interface). 
</p>
<p>
    In medical industry, nurses, doctors, and technicians use safety-critical medical devices 
    that must be safe to use. In automation industry, there is need for well-placed, prominent error indicators.
</p>
<p>
    Examples:
    <ul>
        <li>The detection of brake failure in a car and showing indication about this to a driver.</li>
        <li>The detection of a malfunction in a medical device and shutting down the device operations as a result of this.</li>
    </ul>
 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Typical Operation</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication between Qt Safe Renderer and Main UI minimized.</li>
        <li>Qt Safe Renderer draws predefined bitmaps to screen based on system events.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Main UI Recovery</h2>
<p>
    <li>Qt Safe Renderer listens to heartbeat from Main UI.In case of failure, it can restart the Main UI.</li>

<h2 class="section-heading">Qt Safe Renderer Architecture and Runtime</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Safety critical UI drawn to a separate Hardware layer.</li>
        <li>Qt Safe Renderer listens to heartbeat from Main Ui and control it.</li>
        <li>No changes to safety critical code due to UI changes.</li>
    </ul>
