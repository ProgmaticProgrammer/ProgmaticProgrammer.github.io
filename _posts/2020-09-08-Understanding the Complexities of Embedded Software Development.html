<h2 class="section-heading">Embedded is More Challenging Than You Might Expect</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            They are specialized, single-purpose devices
        </li>
        <li>
            High reliability is a requirement
        </li>
        <li>
            They may have real-time constraints
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Locking down hardware before any code has been written
    </li>
    <li>
        Assuming UX design will be done once and never change
    </li>
    <li>
        Not doing formal UX design
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing on desktop and then porting to embedded
    </li>
    <li>
        Underestimating effort for testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Not enough communication between teams doing application, OS, hardware
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Secret to Success - Best Practices</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Leverage existing software. Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Underestimate the effort necessary to set up your development tools and a stable OS with BSP.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use source code control (usually some form of git plus web UI).
    </li>
    <li>
        Continuous integration with automated builds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow test-driven development (or at least unit tests).
    </li>
    <li>
        Measure test coverage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Code reviews regularly.
    </li>
